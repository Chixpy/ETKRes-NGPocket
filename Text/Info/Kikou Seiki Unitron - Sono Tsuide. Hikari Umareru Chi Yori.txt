Kikou Seik Unitron is the sequel to Biomotor Unitron. It was only released in Japan.

It continues the gameplay of Biomotor Unitron with top down dungeons and menu-based combat. The story takes place 400 years in the future from the original. This time you control 10 characters. Like the original your main priorities are upgrading your Unitron robot. The game features more dungeons than the original and they are partly randomized on each play through. Using a link cable you can pit your Unitron against that of friends.
